              <p>In a solar initiative approved by the Ugandan Government and the Ugandan Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Dala has partnered with CleanPath Emerging Markets (CP-EM) who are developing a  gigawatt-scale solar program for Uganda that will employ $DALA as the principle transactional currency program-wide, allowing Ugandan consumers to purchase solar power in $DALA, workers to be paid in $DALA and the program to run on $DALA.  </p>
              <p>The gigawatt program - more than double the current generation capacity in Uganda - will provide clean energy to over 2 million households (25% of the UG population)  create essential employment at scale, while initiating growth of a clean energy economy, through stimulating new economic development in Uganda. </p>

              <p>In an initiative to drive financial inclusion and economic growth, Dala and Block Commodities, a commodities company in emerging markets, are working in partnership to provide an equivalent of US$10M in $DALA loans to approximately 50,000 smallholder farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa, starting in Uganda. </p>
              <p>Loans will be provided via Dalaâ€™s trustless and decentralized lending protocol, Kopa, enabling farmers to purchase fertilizer, raise productivity, and secure better returns for produce.</p>
